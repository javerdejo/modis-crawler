# Simple MODIS Web Crawler
###### version 0.18.20.8-beta

## Introduction

MODIS Web Crawler is a simple crawler that allows you to automatically download files from the [OceanColor website](https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/) for products of the Aqua satellite mission. The crawler ONLY downloads those files that are not in our local repository.

## Configuration

The crawler uses two configuration files which are:

```
- config.py
- url.json
```


### config.py

```python
log_file_name = '/crawler/log/crawler.log'
download_path = '/crawler/files'
urls = '/crawler/url.json'
```
- *log_file_name* sets the path where the log file containing all the operations that the cvrawler has made will be saved.
- *download_path* sets the path where the downloaded files will be stored (local repository).
- *download_path* urls is a file in JSON format where the products to be downloaded are established.

### url.json
```json
{
  "base": "https://oceandata.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov",
  "platform": "MODIS-Aqua",
  "level": "Mapped",
  "period": "Monthly",
  "pixel": "4km",
  "products": [
    {"name": "chlor_a"},
    {"name": "sst"}
  ]
}
```
